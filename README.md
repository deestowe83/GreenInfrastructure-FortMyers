#  Green Infrastructure for Runoff Reduction and Aquifer Recharge in Downtown Fort Myers

## Overview
This project evaluates how small-scale green infrastructure (GI) interventions can reduce stormwater runoff and enhance aquifer recharge in downtown Fort Myers, Florida. The study area focuses on the highly impervious block surrounding Ford’s Garage and Main Street.

## Objectives
- Map impervious areas using GIS.
- Model baseline runoff and recharge with the Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) toolkit.
- Simulate GI retrofits such as rain gardens and permeable pavements.
- Compare infiltration and recharge between baseline and GI scenarios.

## Research Question
*How effective are small-scale green-infrastructure interventions at reducing stormwater runoff and enhancing aquifer recharge in dense coastal downtowns?*

## Data & Tools
- **GIS Data:** Lee County parcels, rainfall, soil, and elevation layers.  
- **Modeling Tools:** IUWM Toolkit, QGIS/ArcGIS Pro.  
- **References:**

## Expected Outcomes
- Quantify the reduction in surface runoff and the increase in aquifer recharge from GI retrofits.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for Fort Myers urban stormwater planning.  
- Demonstrate a reproducible GIS + modeling workflow that supports coastal-city resilience.
